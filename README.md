# 🪄 Pointify

💡 Estimating stories shouldn’t feel like rocket science – that’s why I created **Pointify**, a simple, no-nonsense tool for story estimation.

---

## 📝 Project Description

**Pointify** streamlines agile story estimation for teams. The **admin** creates a team — the system generates a unique **Team ID**, which other members can use to join.
During estimation, everyone votes privately in real time. Once all votes are in, the **admin** can reveal the results — showing each member’s vote, the **average score**, and a **recommended Fibonacci value**.

**Admins** have full control: they can **remove users**, **clear votes**, or **delete the team** when the session is over.

🔒 **Privacy-first:** No data is stored permanently. All data is automatically deleted after **3 hours** or as soon as the admin deletes the team.

No fluff. No clutter. Just fast, collaborative estimation that actually works.
